6/22: The other notebook was getting unwieldy, so splitting these into smaller notebooks. While I work on it, stuff is just copy/pasted from the other notebook to sit here until I sort it into its new notebook.

* Change by origin - *(natural, international, domestic)* - state, county; town not available through PES
* Change by age *(need to define bands)* - state, county; town?
* Change by race *(major three/four and other?)* - state, county; town?
* Change by household type/size *(see town reports)* - state, county; town?
* Change by income *(need to define bands)* - state, county; town?

## Change by origin stuff
Periods are annual estimates from July 1–June 30 where period 2 is 2011, period 3 is 2012, etc. **EXCEPTION:** Period 1 is April 1–June 30, 2010 because of decennial census.
