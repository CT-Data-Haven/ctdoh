Cost burden
================

``` r
library(ipumsr)
library(tidyverse)
library(srvyr)
```

Looking at cost burden by a few demographic factors and geographic
levels. Separately, looking at cost burden by the presence of a
household member with a disability.

Crappy charts until I get through all the code, then Iâ€™ll pretty them
up.

``` r
ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("../input_data/usa_00036.xml")
read_pums <- read_ipums_micro(ddi, verbose = F)

#not currently doing anything with age
#also dropped sex from analysis
ct_pums <- read_pums %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(YEAR, PUMA, OWNERSHP, OWNERSHPD, SEX, RACE, RACED, HISPAN, HISPAND,
                                 DIFFREM, DIFFPHYS, DIFFMOB, DIFFCARE, DIFFEYE, DIFFHEAR), as_factor) %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(PERWT, HHWT), as.numeric) %>% 
    mutate_at(vars(HHINCOME, POVERTY, AGE, OWNCOST, RENTGRS), as.integer) %>% 
    #below flags for 0-1x, 1-2x, 2x+ fpl, but could use other cut points
    mutate(fpl = if_else(POVERTY < 100, "0 to 100% FPL", "201% FPL or more")) %>% 
    mutate(fpl = if_else((POVERTY >= 100 & POVERTY <=200), "101% to  200% FPL", fpl)) %>% 
    # Asian is perhaps the only other race category that might not be too small
    mutate(hoh_race = if_else(HISPAN == "Not Hispanic", as.character(RACE), "Latino")) %>% 
    mutate(hoh_race = as.factor(hoh_race) %>% 
                    fct_recode(Black = "Black/African American/Negro") %>%
                    fct_other(keep = c("White", "Black", "Latino"), other_level = "Other race") %>%
                    fct_relevel("White", "Black", "Latino", "Other race")) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names()

#logical flag for any disability
ct_pums$has_disability <- apply(ct_pums, 1, function(x) any(grep("Has|Yes", x)))
```

## Town-level

Cost burden by tenure

## Disability

Cost burden by tenure for households where at least one household member
has a disability. Not sure of the n yet but if I can do this by PUMA, I
will.
