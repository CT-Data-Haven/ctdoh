```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T, message = F, warning = F)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

This was done in another notebook (households by type) so I'm just pulling out total households since it was requested separately.

```{r}
hhlds <- read_csv("../output_data/household_type_2000_2018.csv")

hhlds %>% filter(group == "total_households", year != 2010, level != "3_towns") %>% 
	select(year, level, name, value) %>% 
	group_by(level, name) %>% 
	mutate(dif = value - lag(value)) %>% 
	select(level, name, dif) %>% 
	filter(!is.na(dif), name != "Connecticut") %>% 
	ggplot(aes(dif, reorder(name, dif))) +
	geom_col(aes(fill = level), width = .8) +
	geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = "grey65", alpha = .8) +
	geom_text(aes(label = scales::comma(dif, accuracy = 1)), hjust = 1.2, family = "Roboto Condensed") +
	scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(.01, .05)))+
	scale_fill_manual(values = c("cadetblue3")) +
	hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc() +
	labs(title = "Change in total households, 2000â€“2018",
			 x = "", y = "") +
	theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
				panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
				plot.title.position = "plot",
				legend.position = "none",
				axis.text.x = element_blank(),
				axis.text.y = element_text(colour = "black"))
